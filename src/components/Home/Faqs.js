          <h3>Do you take commissions?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes! I love discussing more personal, requested work. See my
            commissions page for more.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>How much do commissions cost?</h3>
          <p>
            It entirely depends on the size, difficulty, and time involved.
            Happy to discuss on a case-by-case basis.

          <h3>Do you ship anywhere in the world?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes! Shipping is added to the cost of the piece and discussed with
            you, the customer.

          <h3>Do you do art in different sizes?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes! Most prints are A4, with a couple of A3 prints scattered
            throughout. My commission sizes vary - from as small as A5 to as big
            as A2 currently!

          <h3>What materials do you use?</h3>
          <p>
            At the moment, mostly heavyweight Bristol paper and uni-pen
            fineliner (from 0.05mm to 0.8mm). Always looking to try new
            materials and nibs!
